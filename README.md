# clusterFTP

This program was developed to streamline the management of large file transfers between Linux computers in clusters or computer labs. One example of such a transfer is distributing VM images to all or multiple computers in a teaching lab. Copying these files using conventional methods can take hours and disrupt the flow of other network traffic and services.
